## My Role
Full-Stack Software Developer

## Overview

The University of British Columbia Marketing Association (UBCMA) is a student-led club that provides value-packed events and development opportunities for students of all years and faculties. We execute events that educate students about the inner workings of the Marketing field and engage them in leveraging their newly acquired knowledge and skills. As a Director of Technology & Software Developer, I contributed to the development and launch of our membership web portal.

## Problem Space

Student organizations often run into difficulties when their current systems become unable to handle the speed at which their operations are scaling.

Our membership acts as an access pass into all of our networking events and conferences. Our previous system for tracking who our members were was through **a spreadsheet that listed the names and emails of all students who purchased a membership through Showpass** (A 3rd party online ticketing software).

This left a large amount of work for our executive team, who needed to **manually cross reference** this spreadsheet with a list of people who signed up for an event to ensure that only members were attending. This became a **tedious process at our major events** when we needed to verify the member statuses of 200+ attendees. Thus, our development team was tasked with **building an all-in-one platform to automate membership management, track engagement, and ensure that only members are able to access our events.**

## Tech Stack

The application was built on a TypeScript, React, and NextJS stack that connects with a Firebase backend (user data, authentication, event data) and integrates with Stripe for payment services.
