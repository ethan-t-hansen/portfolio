## My Role
Full-Stack Software Developer

## Overview

This project was modelled after a Seattle-based law firm that deals with legal court cases for vehicle-related ticket fines. The firm keeps track of tickets, officers, clients, courts, judges, insurance, and other relevant fields that are documented under each case.

## Problem Space

The company's information system was built off of a collection of Excel files, which caused concern for security and efficiency. Our team aimed to build a full-stack application that enabled lawyers manage information about their clients and visualize data in a secure way.

## Tech Stack

The application was built on a JavaScript, HTML, and NodeJS stack that queries and stores data in an Oracle & MySQL database.

  <img src='/assets/logos/html-logo.svg' alt='HTML Logo' className="w-16"/>
  <img src='/assets/logos/node-logo.svg' alt='Node.js Logo' className="w-16"/>
  <img src='/assets/logos/oracle-logo.svg' alt='Oracle Logo' className="w-32"/>
  <img src='/assets/logos/mysql-logo.svg' alt='MySQL Logo' className="w-24 mb-6"/>
</div>

## Takeaways

1. Coding on an **outdated web dev stack** teaches you a lot about the pros & cons of libraries like React and Angular
2. Building the foundation of your projects with **a business application in mind** helps narrow down the scope of your work by a significant margin
