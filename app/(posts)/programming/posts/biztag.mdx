## My Role
Plugin Developer

## Automating the name tag design process

Conferences, case comps, and hackathons make up the highlights of many student's time in universities. Why? Because they combine hands-on learning, creativity, teamwork, networking, and the thrill of solving real-world challenges in a lively, collaborative environment. 

If you've ever attended one of these events, you might notice that professional partners have name tags around their neck. Designing these name tags can take hours of manual work to make the layouts consistent and audit for content mistakes. But what if all that work could be done with the click of a button?

## Meet BizTag

BizTag is a powerful Figma plugin that is built by a designer, for designers. The app communicates with Figma's Plugin API to build a series of clean, customizable, and organized name tags.

All it takes is a background image with a resolution of your choosing, and a .csv file populated with information on your event partners, and you can generate dozens of name tags instantly. The plugin automatically places name, company, and pronouns on the frontside, and generates a QR code to place on the backside using a QR code API.

Each frame comes with auto layout, enabling ease of customizability for the designer.

## Image for Reference

<div className='mt-4'>
  <Image
    src="/assets/project-images/biztag/biztag-2.webp"
    alt="Image"
    width={200}
    height={100}
  />
</div>

## What this means

Overall, this plugin addresses three key designer pain points:

1. **Automation of Information:** Designers no longer have to manually input partner information into text boxes - the application takes that information directly from an uploaded .csv file.
2. **Automation of Layout:** Designers no longer have to fiddle with auto-layout and text sizing - each tag is generated with auto-layout enabled and organized to allow for multi-edit across all nametags.
3. **Automation of QR Generation:** Designers no longer have to convert their own QR codes, the app fetches and generates a QR code for you.

## Tech Stack

The BizTag plugin is built using the following technologies:

- **Figma Plugin API:** Utilized for integrating the plugin with Figma’s design environment and communicating directly with the canvas.
- **TypeScript:** For ensuring type safety and enhancing code maintainability.
- **React:** Implemented for building the plugin’s user interface.

## Takeaways

1. Stepping outside your comfort zone can help you **see how code can simplify your work systems**.
2. **Learning by doing** is the **most effective way to become a better developer** - tracing bugs, uncovering errors, and reading through documentation leads to resilience and innovation.
3. **Challenging yourself** can be fun! (at a reasonable pace)
