## My Role
Lead UI / UX Designer

## Overview

UBC BizTech is the largest technology club at UBC, striving to create immersive technological experiences across various fields, including finance, gaming, and engineering. They foster an active community of students and professionals through learning opportunities, enduring relationships, and interactive industry events. Their full-stack web application is a central hub for students to purchase membership and sign up for various events such as hackathons and tech conferences.

## Problem Space

The application was designed to solve the common pain points that student-run organizations often have associated with (a) paid membership management and (b) large-scale event organization . Although the app was novel and innovative in the features that it offered, it did not come without it's flaws - confusing user flows, poor responsiveness from desktop to mobile, and overly complex functionality were prevalent pain points with users. To start off, I bucketed these into three actionable areas of improvement.

## Areas of Improvement

1. **Streamlined User Flow** 
   
    The app tied users of the application to membership - if a new user wanted to create an account and view events, they would instantly be redirected to purchase a membership if they didn’t have one. By preventing access without membership, there were many edge cases that generated unnecessary friction throughout the sign in progress.

2. **Responsive Layouts** 
   
    Each page on the application has a unique mobile layout that dynamically changes based on the browser window size. For mobile devices, this is typically a width of 480px - 600px. Users will now be able to have a consistent experience across devices.

3. **Improved Admin Experience** 
    By building out a view that allows admins to select attendees and perform functions based on selection, users no longer have to type out each attendee’s email manually in order to check them in - they can simply select their record from the table and click a couple of buttons.

## User Research

| User Type       | Needs                                      |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Guest	| View event details, create account, purchase membership |
| Non-Member User |	View event details, customize profile, purchase membership |
| Member User	| View event details, register for events, customize profile |
| BizTech Executive | Manage event attendees, check attendees in |
| Data Team	| View statistics (members + attendee), download raw data, compare historical data |
| Events Team |	Create / edit event pages, generate QR codes, create teams for competitions |

## Implementation

The new design featured a modern, responsive interface that prioritized simplicity and engagement. I worked on:

- **Redesigning the Homepage** with a clear call to action for new members and a featured section for upcoming events.
- **User-Centered Navigation**, streamlining access to key areas like events, membership benefits, and club achievements.
- **Building a Member Dashboard** where users could view personalized content, upcoming events, and important announcements.

## Takeaways

- **Importance of User-Centered Design:** Understanding the needs of different user groups was crucial to the success of the redesign.
- **Iterative Design Process:** Regular feedback from users helped refine and improve the design over time.
- **Collaborative Approach:** Working closely with club members and leadership ensured that the new portal aligned with the club's goals and values.
